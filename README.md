# react basic: WebPack + React + LESS

## v0.2.0

## Problem

I wanted a minimal setup I could reuse and easily keep up to date. This is very barebones and, therefore useful in that WebPack can be a pain to set up, so I have my basic tool kit an “npm i” away.

## History

I started with an earlier version of Webpack some time ago, and I left it incomplete until recently when I updated and retooled the project. 

## Usage

Open for anyone to use:

* Standard git setup, I will accept PRs that do not expand the scope and usability of the project. 
* `npm i`, If that does not do it, there may be some standard `-g` things needed. I use npm, nvm, and have a basic .zshrc setup. I am always as current as possible with this core. 
* `npm run start` || `npm run build` depending on env. 

### Testing
 I have not set up any testing env, as approaches and opinions vary widely. If I had to add something, I'd lean toward Jest+React Testing Libary because that is what I have used most recently.
